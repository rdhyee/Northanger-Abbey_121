description: "For films named Northanger Abbey, see Northanger Abbey (1986 film) or\
  \ Northanger Abbey (2007 film).\nNorthanger Abbey /ˈnɔːrθˌæŋɡər/ was the first of\
  \ Jane Austen's novels to be completed for publication, though she had previously\
  \ made a start on Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice. According to Cassandra\
  \ Austen's Memorandum, Susan (as it was first called) was written circa 1798–99.\
  \ It was revised by Austen for the press in 1803, and sold in the same year for\
  \ £10 to a London bookseller, Crosby & Co., who decided against publishing. In the\
  \ spring of 1816, the bookseller was content to sell it back to the novelist's brother,\
  \ Henry Austen, for the exact sum—£10—that he had paid for it at the beginning,\
  \ not knowing that the writer was by then the author of four popular novels.\nThe\
  \ novel was further revised by Austen in 1816/17, with the intention of having it\
  \ published. Among other changes, the lead character's name was changed from Susan\
  \ to Catherine, and Austen retitled the book Catherine as a result.\nAusten died\
  \ in July 1817. Northanger Abbey (as the novel was now called) was brought out posthumously\
  \ in late December 1817 (1818 given on the title page), as the first two volumes\
  \ of a four-volume set that also featured another previously unpublished Austen\
  \ novel, Persuasion. Neither novel was published under the title Jane Austen had\
  \ given it; the title Northanger Abbey is presumed to have been the invention of\
  \ Henry Austen, who had arranged for the book's publication.\n From Wikipedia (CC\
